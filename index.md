# Lazy Developer Website

  - Uses developer standard tools
  - Let someone else do the hosting
  - Don't want it to look ugly
  - Don't want to have to work to hard to make it look pretty

# Developer Standard Tools
What are we talking about?

  - Markdown
  - Git - used to manage source code
  - Github - used to store code
  - Simple text editor
  - Command line fun !
  - Not Windows!!!

Start from the bottom - 

## Unix based OS
Most web developers work on either some form of Linux, or Mac.
Reason - Servers run Linux, that's where websites run, so we need to run Linux to be able to develop for these servers. Mac has many similarities so it's usually OK too

We should be able to do the first part of this on a windows machine, but will struggle to do the more advanced parts - what should we do?
  
  - Pair programming - who's got a decent machine?

## Git and Github
Let's setup a github.com account, and download git (windows client, or command line)

## Text editor
Sublime Text / Atom
None of that notepad crap.

## Markdown
This is markdown. It's readable in text format and easily converted to HTML

# Let's get started

Follow instructions - https://pages.github.com/

### Second try - a markdown page
https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/

### Make it look a bit better
CSS frameworks - Bootstrap / Foundation

### Jekyll
Static blog generator - requires linux (woop!)
